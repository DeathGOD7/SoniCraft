<p>With a severe lack of Sonic the Hedgehog mods for Minecraft (especially in modern versions like 1.16.5), I have decided to take matters into my own hands. In honor of Sonic the Hedgehog's 30 anniversary, I, EnderPreston, the creator of Village Employment, am proud to present...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2jvmGKdm/Logo.png" width="556" height="139" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the biggest Minecraft mod I have ever made, and as such, I would strongly recommend using Just Enough Items or Roughly Enough Items for the recipes. Because there are so many blocks and items in this mod, I don't think I'll be able to talk about all of them, so I'll just talk about the big stuff: the interactive blocks, the characters, and Sonic's world!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interactive Blocks:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>For the most part, all of the blocks based on the games act just like their game counterparts, but I'll still go over them, anyways. However, a few of the "blocks" listed here are actually interactive structures made of other blocks.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k45zV9KN/Gold-Ring.png" width="90" height="90" /></p>
<p>Gold Ring</p>
<p>You can find these in a few of the structures in Sonic's world, or you can make your own. You can break them the good old fashion way with tools and such, or you can walk into them to pick them up, and if you ask me, the latter is much cooler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/V6N3QPFh/Springs.png" width="270" height="90" /></p>
<p>Spring</p>
<p>These bouncy bounce pads can be placed in all 6 directions, and they come in 3 different variants. Yellow springs only bounce you a few blocks high, red springs are much stronger, and modern springs are the same as red springs, but with a different design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Hx3Mh979/Monitor.png" width="90" height="90" /></p>
<p>Item Box</p>
<p>Item Boxes can be found in Sonic's world, but they can also be crafted. When crafted, they start off empty. Empty Item Boxes can be used as TVs for the Sega Genesis, or crafted into proper Item Boxes, with actual items in them. They can also be crafted into Character Item Boxes, which look like Extra Life Item Boxes, but they actually summon&nbsp;Hero characters that can help you in several different ways!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KvCMwz4w/Starpost.png" width="89" height="89" /></p>
<p>Starpost</p>
<p><strong>WIP</strong></p>
<p>You'd think this would be used to set your spawnpoint, but due to technical limitations, this block is strictly cosmetic for the time being. Other than not setting your spawnpoint, this acts exactly like the Starposts in the games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3w524RTm/Goal-Plate.png" width="90" height="90" /></p>
<p>Goal Plate</p>
<p>No, this doesn't set your spawnpoint, either, but it does spin when you, or one of the Hero characters, walk into it. When it's done spinning, it will show who last walked into it. If a player right-clicks <em>their</em> Goal Plate with a Special Stage Key, they'll get a Chaos Emerald!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Jhx92zjJ/Bumpers.png" width="180" height="90" /></p>
<p>Bumpers</p>
<p>Located in Spring Yard Zone and sometimes Casino Night Zone, these blocks can be pretty fun, but they can also get quite annoying after a while, especially when you're trying to get some loot or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bJqbgBdv/Chaos-Emerald-Power-Generator.png" width="90" height="90" /></p>
<p>Chaos Emerald Power Generator</p>
<p>When a Chaos Emerald is placed into this machine, it'll output a redstone signal. Don't put a Fake Chaos Emerald in there, though, unless you want the machine to blow up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/brBtzYgG/Sega-Genesis.png" width="90" height="90" /></p>
<p>Sega Genesis</p>
<p>Also known as the Mega Drive (Yes, I did make sure this was called the "Mega Drive" for Minecraft's UK language setting), this game console was the birthplace of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. In Chemical Plant Zone, you can find cartridges for this console, but you'll need an Empty Item Box as a TV in order for all of this to work. Also, this is strictly for roleplay and decoration. Due to technical limitations, and for legal reasons, you can't actually play any games on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Vkbjkt3z/Capsule.png" width="128" height="137" /></p>
<p>Capsule</p>
<p>There are little animals inside of these 3-block-tall contraptions located all over Sonic's world. You can break it open with tools if you want, but in my opinion, it's much more satisfying to stomp down on that big yellow button at the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/jj4nD4vY/Syringe.png" width="60" height="205" /></p>
<p>Syringe</p>
<p>You can find these in Chemical Plant, and they come in two colors: light blue and green. When the player jumps onto that big yellow plunger at the top, the syringe will inject the Mega Mack blocks below it, and turn them into bouncier Mega Mack blocks.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Characters:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>Hero characters can be summoned using Character Item Boxes, and they can even be healed when fed their favorite foods. Villain characters are hostile, and that's pretty much it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tJdKj8Dx/Shadow-Soni-Craft.png" width="93" height="126" /></p>

<p>Rouge the Bat</p>
<p>Hero</p>
<p>Favorite Food: Unknown, but her favorite items are gems like diamonds and emeralds<br />Abilities: She has wings, but she doesn't really use them that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PqRhVGFf/Eggman-Soni-Craft.png" width="129" height="194" /></p>
<p>Dr. Eggman</p>
<p>Villain</p>
<p>Abilities: His machines (He uses a bomb-dropping, laser-equipped Eggmobile in Scrap Brain Zone, and his trusty Death Egg Robot in Death Egg Zone.)</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sonic's world:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>This zone can be reached using a Giant Ring, which is activated using Flint and Ring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZRDgpgxG/GIant-Ring.png" width="95" height="131" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the biomes that you'll see there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPRX3dB3/2021-04-20-15-48-18.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Green Hill Zone</p>
<p>Basically the plains biome of Sonic's world. Keep your eyes peeled for Chao Gardens and even Tails' Workshop!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QCMt9gPV/2021-04-20-15-50-48.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Marble Zone</p>
<p>The surface may look barebones, but the big tourist attraction here is the dungeons below. However, I will admit, the dungeons are kind of a work-in-progress, since only one kind of dungeon generates here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Yq35yKvc/2021-04-20-15-54-39.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Spring Yard Zone</p>
<p>A fun zone for those who like to bounce around uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/C1ktG93Q/2021-04-29-20-43-43.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Star Light Zone</p>
<p>If you need a place to chill out, this is a good place to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4NDfsTJY/2021-04-20-15-51-24.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Scrap Brain Zone</p>
<p>This is where you'll find several different kinds of death traps and even an Eggman boss fight!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PfBJrDyf/2021-04-20-15-52-18.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Chemical Plant Zone</p>
<p>If you like bouncing around, swimming, or collecting a bunch of loot, this zone is for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vmHfLnpF/2021-04-20-15-53-05.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Aquatic Ruin Zone</p>
<p>Basically the ocean biome of Sonic's world. You can even find Labyrinth Zone beneath the surface of this biome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3R0hPLPX/2021-04-20-16-00-04.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Casino Night Zone</p>
<p>Feeling lucky? The giant slot machines here actually work, and they give you stuff if you can get a match!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:&nbsp;</strong>One time, while I testing out the slot machines, the game spontaneously crashed. I had used the slot machine at least 50 times at that point. I don't know what caused the crash, so just be cautious, and please let me know if this happens to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fyQG1M7s/2021-04-21-15-02-04.png" width="256" height="144" /></p>
<p>Death Egg Zone</p>
<p>Not actually a biome, but if you can make it past the death traps, it definitely pays off!</p>
